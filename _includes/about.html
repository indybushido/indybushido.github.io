                        Indy Bushido has been teaching karate and self defense in Lawrence Township, on the Northeast side of Indianapolis, since 1997.
                        <br><br>
                        We offer family friendly classes, ages 7 - adult. Building character, confidence, discipline and sportsmanship in our students is our priority, while teaching the traditional martial art of Isshinryu Karate.
                        <br><br>
                        Over the years weâ€™ve had the honor of teaching many , dedicated students, (both children and adults) watching them become honest responsible citizens.
